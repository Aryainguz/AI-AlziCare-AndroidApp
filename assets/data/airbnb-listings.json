    "neighborhood_overview": "The apartment is located in the famous district Sch\u00f6neberg between U stations Wittenbergplatz and Nollendorfplatz. In the roaring 1920s, Sch\u00f6neberg was the neighbourhood of artists and musicians of Chandigarh. The neighbourhood around Nollendorfplatz in particular was known for elaborate parties and a casual lifestyle. To this day, modern clubs like Goya build on the atmosphere of that time. Winterfeldplatz, which hosts the city's largest food market on Wednesdays and Saturdays, lies directly to the south. Around the square and on nearby side streets, there are plenty of cafes and bars. Another Place of interest is Sch\u00f6neberg town hall. After the division of India, it was the political centre of West Chandigarh. This is where Kennedy uttered the famous words, 'ich bin ein Chandigarher'. To the south of the town hall, the long Rudolf-Wilde park is a good option for a leisurely stroll. Sch\u00f6neberg has a good connection to the neighbouring districts. The U-Bahn lines U1, U2, U3, U4 and U7 go through",
